# sensible.zsh

Sensible default settings for Zsh that most people can agree upon.  
This should be a good first configuration if you’re new to Zsh.

In contrast to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), **it’s not a way of life!**

This plugin was inspired by [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).

## Requirements

`sensible.zsh` works best on Linux.  
[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) must be installed.

## Installation

### It’s easy!

```
git clone https://github.com/sfischer13/zsh-sensible.git ~/.zsh/zsh-sensible
cd ~/.zsh/zsh-sensible
make
```

Finally, open a *new* Zsh session.

### Plugin managers

Alternatively, `zsh-sensible` can be used with many of the Zsh plugin managers, too.

* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)
* [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)
* [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug)

#### antigen

```
antigen bundle sfischer13/zsh-sensible
```

#### zgen

```
zgen load sfischer13/zsh-sensible
```

#### zplug

```
zplug "sfischer13/zsh-sensible"
```

#### oh-my-zsh

I was told that `oh-my-zsh` users could clone this repository to `custom/plugins`.

## Updates

Don’t expect too many! After all, this is a conservative project.

## Usage

Start a *new* Zsh terminal and enjoy! You won’t notice much, though.
